**Summary**: I'm a Computer Science and Physics student, currently writing up my Master thesis. I'm interested in Data & AI roles located in Zürich.

### A few words about me
- 🎓 My curiosity and interest to understand how things work led me to do a (Bachelor's and) Master's degree in Physics at the University of Stuttgart (Stuttgart, Germany). During these studies, I became very interested in artificial intelligence (AI), which led me to pursue a second Master's degree in Computer Science (with a major in [Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://into.aalto.fi/display/enccis/Machine+Learning%2C+Data+Science+and+Artificial+Intelligence+%28Macadamia%29+2020-2022)), which I' m currently completing at Aalto University (Helsinki, Finland).
- 👨‍💻 I develop on [BOSS](https://gitlab.com/cest-group/boss), an open-source Bayesian machine learning library for optimization in computational materials science. For example [here](https://gitlab.com/cest-group/boss/-/merge_requests/21) or [here](https://gitlab.com/cest-group/boss/-/merge_requests/19) you can see parts of my code contributions.
- 🔭 I research how multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization can accelerate the structure search in computational materials science. My recent work on this has received the [best poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mankuch/physics-days-2022/master/results/poster.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABMEMTMFPRPSMAKLZNSNCI2GYRINGDA) award at the _Physics Days 2022_, Finlands annual international Physics conference.
- 🎓 I’m currently working on my second Master thesis in CS.
- 🌱 I’m also learning about the fundamentals of web software development (including relevant languages and tools such as JavaScript, Docker / Docker Compose or PostgreSQL)
- 👯 I’m looking to work in Zürich on a Data & AI role.
